    "--- OLIST E-COMMERCE DATASET: ML FEATURE ARCHITECTURE REPORT ---\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this pre-processing pipeline was to establish a high-integrity, predictive feature space by prioritizing variance control, temporal integrity, and domain-aware imputation over simple data deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. CUSTOMERS & SELLERS DATA (Geospatial Integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACTION: Applied rigorous standardization (lower/strip) to all `city` and `state` columns.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: Ensures uniformity for future geospatial feature engineering (e.g., embeddings) and prevents subtle textual variations from inflating categorical cardinality.\n",
    "- OUTLIER CHECK: Confirmed NO statistical outliers in Zip Code Prefixes (ZIPs are categorical identifiers, not continuous features).\n",
    "- OUTCOME: Clean, linkable demographic/location data for Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Logistics Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ORDERS DATA (Temporal Causality & Target Population)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACTION: Filtered dataset to retain only orders with `order_status` == 'delivered'.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: Establishes the necessary 'Ground Truth' for supervised models (delivery time, satisfaction). Incomplete orders are noise for these tasks.\n",
    "- ACTION: Converted all 5 timestamp columns to datetime objects and performed **TARGETED NULL DROPPING** on critical internal dates (`order_approved_at`, `order_delivered_carrier_date`).\n",
    "- ACTION: Explicitly removed orders violating temporal causality (e.g., approval before purchase, delivery before carrier).\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: This crucial step protects the integrity of all derived time-difference features (like 'Delivery Lead Time') from non-physical errors.\n",
    "- OUTCOME: A temporally consistent central hub table for high-fidelity feature joining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ORDER ITEMS DATA (The Skewness Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "- OUTLIER DETECTED: Extreme right-skewed outliers in `price` and `freight_value` (the 'Whale Orders').\n",
    "- ACTION: Applied **Logarithmic Transformation** ($\\\\log(1+x)$) to create `price_log` and `freight_value_log`.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: This transformation is chosen over deletion because the extreme values are REAL and predictive. Log-transform stabilizes variance, normalizes the distribution, and ensures compatibility with linear algorithms without sacrificing the influence of high-value signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. PRODUCTS DATA (Dimensionality and Attribute Robustness)\n",
    "\n",
    "- FEATURE CREATION: Explicitly derived the feature **`product_volume_cm3`** (Length * Height * Width) as a primary predictor for freight cost.\n",
    "- IMPUTATION STRATEGY: Imputed all missing physical dimensions/counts using the **MEDIAN**.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: The median is robust against the sparse outliers common in product dimensions, preserving the central tendency for logistics modeling.\n",
    "- OUTLIER CONTROL (Weight/Volume): Applied **Logarithmic Transformation** to `product_weight_g` and the newly created `product_volume_cm3` for variance stabilization (similar to Order Items).\n",
    "- OUTLIER CONTROL (Description): Applied **99th Percentile Capping (Winsorizing)** to `product_description_length`.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: This is a targeted strategy to limit the influence of the few extremely verbose descriptions on numerical proxies for text complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. ORDER REVIEWS DATA (Sentiment Signal Integrity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- IMPUTATION STRATEGY: Filled the ~88% nulls in `review_comment_message` with the **'no comment'** string.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: A missing comment is a **meaningful, sentiment-neutral categorical class** for future NLP and satisfaction models.\n",
    "- OUTLIER DECISION (Scores): Statistical outliers (low scores of 1 or 2) were **RETAINED**.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: These are high-leverage, negative feedback data points essential for training **Churn and Customer Satisfaction Models**. Removing them would introduce positive bias.\n",
    "- INTEGRITY: Removed 814 duplicate `review_id` values to ensure clean 1:1 join with the central Orders table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. PAYMENTS DATA (Financial Variance Control)\n",
    "\n",
    "- OUTLIER DETECTED: Extreme right-skew in `payment_value`.\n",
    "- ACTION: Applied **99.9th Percentile Capping (Winsorizing)** to create `capped_payment_value`.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: Capping is superior to deletion/log-transform here; it directly limits the influence of 'Whale' transactions on **L2 loss (MSE)**, stabilizing model training without removing the critical high-value signal.\n",
    "- ZERO-VALUE VALIDATION: Confirmed $0.00 payments are associated with the **'voucher'** payment type. Retained as a definitive, predictive categorical signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. GEOLOCATION DATA (Efficiency and Geographic Purity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- DATA REDUCTION: Dropped over 300,000 redundant duplicate coordinate mappings (on `zip_code_prefix`, `lat`, `lng`).\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: Drastically improves memory footprint and join efficiency for a massive lookup table.\n",
    "- OUTLIER CHECK: Implemented a **Geographic Boundary Check** to remove coordinates falling outside the plausible bounds of Brazil.\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: Ensures that the distance metrics derived from this table are based on physically accurate, valid seller and customer locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. TRANSLATION DATA (Interpretability Layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACTION: No cleaning/transformation required (perfect quality).\n",
    "- ML RATIONALE: The file's sole purpose is to serve as a high-integrity lookup table, providing the essential **English language interpretability layer** for all categorical product features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**FINAL STATUS: All nine relational data sources have been transformed into a dense, high-quality, and variance-stabilized feature matrix, ready for sophisticated EDA, feature engineering (e.g., distance and time-series metrics), and predictive modeling.**"
